This topic provides instructions for using Pivotal Scheduler.

You can interact with the service through the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), [Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html#enable-scheduling), and the [Scheduler HTTP API](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-scheduler/1-1/api/) to configure jobs and outbound HTTP calls and to review history. For general information, see [Managing Service Instances with the cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To start using Pivotal Scheduler, you need the following:

* A PAS deployment with [Pivotal Scheduler](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scheduler-for-pcf) installed and listed in the [Marketplace](http://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/#instances).
* A [Space Developer](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#roles) account.
* (Optional) The cf CLI v6.23.0 or greater and the Pivotal Scheduler CLI plugin installed on your local machine. The Pivotal Scheduler CLI plugin is packaged with the Pivotal Scheduler tile on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-scheduler).

## <a id='create-service'></a>Create and Bind a Service Instance Using the cf CLI

Every app and service in PAS is scoped to a [space](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/roles.html#spaces). This means that an app can use a service only if an instance of the service exists in the same space.

The Pivotal Scheduler service is a singleton service. Only one service instance can be created in a space.

### <a id='run-marketplace'></a>Confirm Service Availability

For apps to use a service, the service must be available in the Marketplace. To confirm the availability of Pivotal Scheduler, perform the following steps:

1. Run `cf marketplace` from the command line.
1. If the output lists `scheduler-for-pcf` in the `service` column, Pivotal Scheduler is available. If the service is not available, install it. See [Installing and Configuring Pivotal Scheduler](./installing.html) for more information.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK
    service             plans      description
    [...]
    scheduler-for-pcf   standard   Scheduler service
    [...]
    </pre>

### <a id='create'></a>Create a Service Instance

To create an instance of the Pivotal Scheduler service, run `cf create-service scheduler-for-pcf standard SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`, replacing `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with a name of your choice. After you create the service instance, this instance name appears under `name` in the output of the `cf services` command.

See the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf create-service scheduler-for-pcf standard my-instance<br>
Creating service my-instance in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK<br>
$ cf services<br>
Getting services in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
name          service            plan    bound apps    last operation
my-instance   scheduler-for-pcf  standard              create succeeded
</pre>

You can create only one instance in a space. If you attempt to create more than one instance in a space, you receive an error response.

### <a id="bind"></a>Bind a Service Instance to Your App

For an app to use a service, you must bind it to a service instance. Do this after you push or re-push the app using `cf push`.

To bind an app to a Pivotal Scheduler instance, run `cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME`, replacing `APP-NAME` with the name of the app you want to use the Pivotal Scheduler service for and `SERVICE-INSTANCE-NAME` with the name you provided when you ran `cf create-service`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf bind-service my-app my-instance<br>
Binding service my-instance to my-app in org my-org / space my-space as user<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf push' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
</pre>

## <a id="manage-jobs"></a>Manage Jobs and Calls

For information about the CLI operations that you can perform to manage jobs and calls in Pivotal Scheduler, see [Using Jobs](using-jobs.html) and [Using Calls](using-calls.html).

If you want to manage jobs and calls through the Scheduler HTTP API, see the [Pivotal Scheduler API Documentation](http://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-scheduler/2-0/api/).

## <a id="using-am"></a> Using Pivotal Scheduler in Apps Manager

For information about binding Pivotal Scheduler to your app and scheduling tasks through Apps Manager, see [Managing Apps and Service Instances Using Apps Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/manage-apps.html#enable-scheduling).
